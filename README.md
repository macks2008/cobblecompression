# cobblecompression
A relatively simple mod, inspired by Extra Utilities 2, quark, and others, that adds 3 x 3 recipe compression and storage blocks for common materials.
It currently supports nothing (I'm writing this before I've coded anything, duh), with planned support for cobblestone, dirt (all varieties), sand, gravel, and (3 x 3 rather than 2 x 2, probably with a block-block conversion) clay
